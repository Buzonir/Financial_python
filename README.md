# Python for financial market

My objective is to learn more about Python and apply my knowledge about brazilian government bonds, private bonds and derivatives.
I have a problem with working days in my code. Apparently, ussing the holidays calendar of ANBIMA, I get divergence in the unit price of Inflation-Linked bonds.
The diferences are in the unit price of NTN-B 2021, NTN-B 2026 and NTN-B 2055. I have about BRL 0.2 divergence when compared to the unit price released by ANBIMA.

Next steps:
- I wanna calculate the convexity of the bond,
- I wanna distribute the exposure of a given cash flow in the most liquids futures ID and
- I wanna make a code to get the DV01 of a given cash flow and how to make the hedge with derivatives for this cashflow.

I appreciate any sugestions.
